      This module runs throughout the academic year, starting in Autumn and ending in Spring. The module
      consists of two parts. In the first, important elements of computer architecture are covered
      including digital logic, computer arithmetic and instruction set architecture. The approach in the
      module is to show how the basic elements of a computer are constructed and combined to give
      sophisticated architectures that support accelerated performance via cache memory and pipelining.
      The second half of the module shows how computing devices can be connected into networks, and covers
      the principles of layered protocols, error detection/correction and reliable transmission over
      networks. [Source](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/2023/computer-science-bsc)
