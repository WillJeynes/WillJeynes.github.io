As part of a machines and intelligence module my team worked on creating a model based reflex agenct capable of navigating in a real world environment using Python and the University of Sheffield's MiRo robots. This project cumulated in a final report showing the development process and data analytics showing a consistently fast solve time for any situations it was given.
