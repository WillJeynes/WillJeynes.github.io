## What did I do?
I was part of the frontend development team working on key areas such as in app purchasing, calculation of calories for custom areas, as well as UX areas such as filtering and the onboarding process. The backend was a nosql database in firebase, and IAPs were handled via Qonversion. The app is available on the Apple App Store
