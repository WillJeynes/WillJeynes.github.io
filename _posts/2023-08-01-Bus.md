This projects involves using the web framework svelte in order to create a static web app capable of using public APIs to track the location and live timetable information of busses around Sheffield, since many are often cancelled with the timetable not updating to reflect this. Combined with the Google Maps API this project should be abile to provide routing information with a greater accuracy.
