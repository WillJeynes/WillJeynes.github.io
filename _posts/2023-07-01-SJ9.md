In ShefJam 9 my team submitted a roguelike type game in order to fit the theme of 'villain'. We created this game in unity using only our own assets and code for all aspects of the game including enemy controllers, item management, item tracking audio and graphics. From this we won 'best interpretation of theme' for the project.
