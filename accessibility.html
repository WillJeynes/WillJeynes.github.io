            <h1>Reasoning for choices</h1>

            <p>
                I feel it is important to make this website accessible to all, therefore technologies such as image
                alternative text and clear navigation were important to me. Because of the use of HTML5 in this website,
                browser extension based screen readers should be able to quickly and easily parse the website content,
                improving usability <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">(Mozilla's guide of HTML semantics for accessibility)</a>
            </p>
            <p>Using some of the steps outlined in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG">the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> this website has been created to be accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
            <p>Some of the key points include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pages have been built with the answers in plain text, meaning those with screen
                    readers could still understand the content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternative text has been provided for all images in the website, in order to improve navigation for the
                    visually impaired.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All text and images in this website feature clear contrasting colors, in order to improve navigation for
                    all.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All content in this website features a larger font typeface and main website links have a large
                    selectable area, in order to simplify navigation.
                </li>
            </ul>
