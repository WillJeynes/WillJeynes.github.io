    <h1>EdFlix Fullstack Team Project</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently working on a University Team Project in which we must create and present a web application in
        Ruby for the discovery of on-line courses. This is written using ruby and sinatra, using erb for the creation of
        dynamic webpages and sqlite as a backend. This project demonstrates my ability to work collaborativley as well
        as my commuication skills during conversations with both the client and larger presentations.

    <h1>Sheffield Bus Tracker</h1>
    <p>
        This projects involves using the web framework svelte in order to create a static web app capable of using
        public APIs to track the location and live timetable information of busses around Sheffield, since many are
        often cancelled with the timetable not updating to reflect this. Combined with the Google Maps API this project
        should be abile to provide routing information with a greater accuracy.

    <h1>ShefJam 9</h1>
    <p>In ShefJam 9 my team submitted a roguelike type game in order to fit the theme of 'villain'. We created this game
        in unity
        using only our own assets and code for all aspects of the game including enemy controllers, item management,
        item tracking
        audio and graphics. From this we won 'best interpretation of theme' for the project.

    <p>The game can be found <a href="http://willjay.rf.gd/intrusivegame/build/">here.</a>

    <h1>Will's Player</h1>
    <p>Will's player is a youtube music front-end written in vanilla JS for compatibility. It uses the <a
            href="https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped">open-source Piped
            API</a> as a webscraper in in order to play video using basic HTML audio elements.</p>

    <h1>Website Generator</h1>
    <p>In order to facilitate fully featured and consistent websites on a static website server I have created a HTML
        site
        generator in Java in order to create websites fit for the modern
        internet. This portfolio site and Will's Player use a system of CSS and modern HTML5 context-sensiteve elements
        in order to
        create modern accessible websites with consistent styling and colour schemes, which, using a generator, can be
        compiled into finished files that can be displayed on the web.</p>

    <h1>Space Clash</h1>
    <p>Space Clash was a web based unity game created for my Extended Project Qualification at college. It features many
        fully functional

        have been shut down the tutorial and offline modes are still online and playable in the browser.</p>
